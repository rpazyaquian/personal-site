## Ch. 1: Numbers

* Write a program which tells you:

	* how many hours are in a year?
	* how many minutes are in a decade?
	* how many seconds old are you?
	* how many chocolates do you hope to eat in your life? (Warning: This part of the program could take a while to compute!)

	Here's a tougher question:

	* If I am 1031 million seconds old, how old am I?

Answer:

		There are 8760 hours in a year.
	There are 5256000 minutes in a decade.
	I am 756864000 seconds old.
	I could conceivably eat 168192000 chocolates in my entire life.
	1,031,000,000 seconds is 32 years.
