title: WDI - Project 3 Ideas
---

- Remake my CHIP-8 interpreter in Javascript.
  - Create a CHIP-8 interpreter following the specs detailed in [Cowgod's Reference](http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM).
  - Use Jasmine or Mocha for testing it.
  - Maybe work in some data storage, somehow?
- A dataviz project using D3.
  - Of what, though?

### Refactor my Project 1!

I need to redo Combo Breaker in an API-webapp format.
