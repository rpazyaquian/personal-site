# Mood Journal

This is something a friend and I were thinking about.

As a way of becoming more familiar with MVC frameworks, I've decided to start a simple MVC-based application. My friend suggested to me that I start a Mood Journal application.

A Mood Journal is a journal where you keep track of your feelings throughout each day. For example, you feel sad - so you write in your Mood Journal, "right now I feel sad.". That's a Mood Entry. A Mood Journal is a collection of all these Mood Entries.

A Mood Entry itself is basically a short description, a date-time stamp, and a "Mood". The short description is a very short, ~140 character-limited blurb about how you curently feel.
