	// ie stuff what changes and is controlled by input.

	// typically, a model is a singular item, many of which will be used in the application.
	// a model is a kind of data structure, holding together various properties.
	// it generally does not define a one-off instance of data.
	// so, a Jet model doesn't make much sense.
	// make a model a KIND of object, e.g. a class.

	// models are typically accompanied by a collection, a grouping of multiple identical models.
	// a good way to think of a collection is to think in term of plurals.
	// if you have a model named User, for example,
	// its matching collection would be Users.
